#### Also check the topic "change detection in satellite images (SAR if possible) using CNN":

my intuition is that pixel by pixel works are not useful anymore, since 1 pixel might have half an object, i.e. information
from multiple inputs. We need to understand the image itself, being able to analyze groups of pixels.
The best way to analyze groups of pixels is applying filters (i.e. Convolutions) and analyzing the filters outputs, which
might contain multiple pixels... Nevertheless it would be cool to be able to analyze pixel wise at the same time that
analysing groups of convolutions,... is this possible?
