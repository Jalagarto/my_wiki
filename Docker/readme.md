    - ```docker version``` shows which version of docker you have running
    
    - Containers: Your basic isolated Docker process. Containers are to Virtual Machines as threads are to processes. Or you can think of them as chroots on steroids.
Lifecycle:

        - ```docker create``` creates a container but does not start it.
        - ```docker rename``` allows the container to be renamed.
        - ```docker run``` creates and starts a container in one operation.
        - ```docker rm``` deletes a container.
        - ```docker update``` updates a container's resource limits.
